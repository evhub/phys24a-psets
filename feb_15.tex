\textbf{Reminder:} \textsl{Midterm 1 will take place on Thursday, 2/18, from 8:10 to
9:25 in our usual classroom. The exam will cover the first four chapters of
Kleppner and Kolenkow. You will not need a calculator.}

\begin{problem}[1 - Center of mass of a non-uniform rod* - KK 4.1]
    The mass per unit length of a non-uniform
    rod of length $l$ is given by $\lambda = 
    A \cos(\pi x/2 l)$, where $x$ is the 
    position along the rod, $0 \le x \le l$.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What is the mass $M$ of the rod?
    \item What is the coordinate $X$ of the center of mass?
    \end{enumerate}
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}[2 - Acrobat and monkey - KK 4.5]
  A circus acrobat of mass $M$ leaps 
  straight up with initial velocity $v_{0}$
  from a trampoline. As he rises up, he 
  takes a trained monkey of mass $m$ off a
  perch at a height $h$ above the trampoline. 
  What is the maximum height attained by the pair?

\begin{problem}[3 - Rocket sled - KK 4.9]
  A rocket sled moves along a horizontal plane, and is retarded by a friction
  force $f_{\rm friction} = \mu W$, where $\mu$ is constant and $W$ is the
  weight of the sled.

  The sled's initial mass is $M$, and its rocket engine expels mass at constant
  rate $dM/dt \equiv \gamma$; the expelled mass has constant speed $v_{0}$
  relative to the rocket.

  The rocket starts from rest and the engine stops when half the sled's total
  mass is gone. Find an expression for the maximum speed.

\begin{problem}[4 - Rolling freight car with sand - KK 4.10]
  A freight car of mass $M$ contains a mass of sand $m$. At $t = 0$ a constant
  horizontal force $R$ is applied in the direction of rolling and at the same
  time a port in the bottom is opened to let the sand flow out at constant rate
  $dm/dt$. Find the speed of the freight car when all the sand is gone. Assume
  the freight car is at rest at $t = 0$.

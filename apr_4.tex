\emph{Nota bene}: \textbf{the second midterm will
be a 3-hour take-home exam, given out 4 April 2016
and due in recitation on Monday, 11 April 2016. 
It will cover through Chapter 7.}

\begin{problem}[Rod and springs - KK 7.17]
A rod of length $l$ and mass $m$, pivoted at one end, is held by a spring at
its midpoint and a spring at its far end, both pulling in opposite
directions. The springs have spring constant $k$, and at equilibrium their
pull is perpendicular to the rod. Find the frequency of small oscillations
around the equilibrium position. (Don't forget about gravity.)

\begin{problem}[Falling plank - KK 7.20]
A thick plank of mass $M$ and length $l$ is pivoted at one end, as shown. The
plank is released at $\dg{60}$ from the vertical. What is the magnitude and
direction of the force on the pivot when the plank is horizontal?

\begin{problem}[Yo-yo pulled at angle - KK 7.28]
The yo-yo of the previous problem is pulled so that the string makes an angle
$\theta$ with the horizontal. For what value of $\theta$ does the yo-yo have
no tendency to rotate?

\begin{problem}[Marble in dish* - KK 7.34]
A marble of radius $b$ rolls back and forth in a shallow dish of radius $R$,
where $R \gg b$. Find the frequency of small oscillations.

\begin{problem}[Plank and ball* - KK 7.37]
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item A plank of length $2l$ and mass $M$ lies on a frictionless table. A
ball of mass $m$ and speed $v_{0}$ strikes its end as shown. Find the final
velocity of the ball, $v_{\rm f}$, assuming that mechanical energy is
conserved and that $v_{\rm f}$ is along the original line of motion.
\item Find $v_{\rm f}$ assuming that the stick is pivoted at the lower end.
